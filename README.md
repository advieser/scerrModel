# scerrModel - A Model for Scientific Errors in Data Analysis
This `R` package implements a formal model of scientific errors in data analysis. The model is based on the work of ... and ... .
This implementation allows the user to simulate a data set of studies while easily manipulating the model parameters.

## Installation
Install this package from github using `devtools`:
```R
devtools::install.github("https://github.com/advieser/scerrModel")
```

## Possible future features
- Tests
  - seed
- Find better solution for plotting than using NAs
  - Fix known bug: If only one study and only one observation (rest NA), can't create plot
